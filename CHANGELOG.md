# Changelog

## 1.0.0 - 2022-02-27

- serena serves static files from a directory on disk
- `-p`/`--port` option to specify the port (default is `3000`)
- `--open` option to open the default browser to the website.
- Automatic browser refresh is the default behavior as that's what I personally find most useful. `--no-auto-refresh` disables auto-refreshing if you don't like that.
